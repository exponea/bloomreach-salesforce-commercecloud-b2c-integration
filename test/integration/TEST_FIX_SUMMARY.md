# Integration Test Fix Summary

## Problem Found

The integration tests were failing with **403 (Forbidden)** errors instead of expected **404 (Not Found)** errors.

### Root Cause

The BloomreachFileDownload controller implements **directory whitelisting** for security. It only allows downloads from specific directories:

```
✅ Whitelisted Directories:
- src/bloomreach_engagement/CustomerFeed/
- src/bloomreach_engagement/ProductFeed/
- src/bloomreach_engagement/VariantFeed/
- src/bloomreach_engagement/ProductInventoryFeed/
- src/bloomreach_engagement/VariantInventoryFeed/
- src/bloomreach_engagement/PreInit/
```

The controller logic:
1. **First** - Checks if path is in whitelist → Returns **403** if not
2. **Then** - Checks if file exists → Returns **404** if not found

The tests were using `src/bloomreach_engagement/test/test-file.csv` which is **NOT** in the whitelist, so they got 403 instead of 404.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Test Configuration

**File:** `test/integration/BloomreachFileDownloadController.integration.test.js`

Changed default test file path from:
```javascript
testFilePath: 'src/bloomreach_engagement/test/test-file.csv'
```

To a whitelisted path:
```javascript
testFilePath: 'src/bloomreach_engagement/CustomerFeed/customers-latest.csv'
```

### 2. Split Test Cases

**Before:** One test expecting 404 for non-existent files

**After:** Two separate tests:

#### Test 1: Non-Whitelisted Path (NEW)
```javascript
it('should return 403 for non-whitelisted paths', ...)
```
- Tests path: `src/bloomreach_engagement/test/file.csv`
- Expects: **403 Forbidden** ✓
- Purpose: Validates whitelist security works

#### Test 2: Non-Existent File in Whitelisted Directory
```javascript
it('should return 404 for non-existent file in whitelisted directory', ...)
```
- Tests path: `src/bloomreach_engagement/CustomerFeed/nonexistent-{timestamp}.csv`
- Expects: **404 Not Found** ✓
- Purpose: Validates file existence checking works

### 3. Updated Documentation

**Files Updated:**
- `test/integration/README.md`
- `test/integration/env.example`
- `test/integration/BloomreachFileDownloadController.integration.test.js` (header comments)

**Changes:**
- Added section explaining whitelisted directories
- Updated default TEST_FILE_PATH in examples
- Added note that paths must be in whitelisted directories
- Updated test count from 11 to 12 tests

## Test Results

### Before Fix
```
❌ 1 passing
❌ 8 pending
❌ 2 failing (getting 403 instead of expected 404)
```

### After Fix
```
✅ All tests properly structured
✅ 12 tests total
✅ Tests skip gracefully when credentials not provided
✅ Tests expect correct HTTP status codes based on controller logic
```

### Running with Credentials (Expected Results)
```
✅ 12 passing
```

## Test Coverage (Updated)

Now testing **12 scenarios**:

### Endpoint Availability (1 test)
- ✓ Endpoint responds

### Authentication (3 tests)
- ✓ Rejects without auth (401)
- ✓ Rejects invalid credentials (401)
- ✓ Accepts valid credentials

### File Download & Security (5 tests)
- ✓ Returns 403 for non-whitelisted paths **(NEW TEST)**
- ✓ Returns 404 for non-existent files in whitelisted directories
- ✓ Blocks path traversal (403)
- ✓ Downloads existing files (200)
- ✓ Includes Content-Disposition header

### Error Handling (2 tests)
- ✓ Returns 400 for missing path
- ✓ Returns 400 for empty path

### Performance (1 test)
- ✓ Responds within time limits

## Security Implications

The fix **improves** security testing by:

1. **Explicitly testing whitelist enforcement** - New test verifies 403 for non-whitelisted paths
2. **Separating concerns** - Different tests for security (403) vs. file existence (404)
3. **Better documentation** - Users now understand the whitelist requirement
4. **Prevents confusion** - Tests now align with actual controller behavior

## Usage Changes

### Before
Users could specify any path:
```bash
TEST_FILE_PATH=src/bloomreach_engagement/test/my-file.csv
```
❌ Would get 403 and test would fail

### After
Users must specify whitelisted paths:
```bash
TEST_FILE_PATH=src/bloomreach_engagement/CustomerFeed/my-file.csv
```
✓ Correct - tests will work as expected

## Files Modified

1. `test/integration/BloomreachFileDownloadController.integration.test.js`
   - Updated default test file path
   - Split "404" test into two tests (403 and 404)
   - Updated documentation comments
   - Updated skip message

2. `test/integration/README.md`
   - Added "Whitelisted Directories" section
   - Updated default TEST_FILE_PATH
   - Updated test coverage list
   - Changed test count to 12

3. `test/integration/env.example`
   - Updated TEST_FILE_PATH default
   - Added comments listing whitelisted directories

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix works, run:

```bash
# 1. Unit tests should still pass
npm run test:unit
# Expected: 89 passing ✓

# 2. Integration tests should be skipped by default
npm run test:integration  
# Expected: 12 pending ✓

# 3. With credentials, tests should pass (if file exists)
INTEGRATION_TEST=true \
SFCC_HOSTNAME=zzra-039.dx.commercecloud.salesforce.com \
DOWNLOAD_USERNAME=your-username \
DOWNLOAD_PASSWORD=your-password \
npm run test:integration
# Expected: 12 passing (or 10 passing + 2 skipped if test file doesn't exist) ✓
```

## Summary

✅ **Problem:** Tests expecting 404 were getting 403  
✅ **Root Cause:** Controller whitelist not accounted for in tests  
✅ **Solution:** Updated test paths and split test cases  
✅ **Result:** Tests now correctly validate both whitelist (403) and file existence (404)  
✅ **Bonus:** Added explicit security test for whitelist enforcement  
✅ **Documentation:** Updated all docs to explain whitelisted directories  

The integration tests now accurately reflect the controller's security model and provide better test coverage!
