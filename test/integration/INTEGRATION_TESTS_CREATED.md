# Integration Tests - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Created comprehensive integration tests for the BloomreachFileDownload controller that test the actual deployed service on Salesforce Commerce Cloud instances.

## Files Created

### 1. Test File
**Path:** `test/integration/BloomreachFileDownloadController.integration.test.js`

A complete integration test suite with 11 tests covering:

#### Test Categories

**Endpoint Availability (1 test)**
- ✓ Verifies the controller endpoint exists and responds

**Authentication (3 tests)**
- ✓ Rejects requests without authentication (should return 401)
- ✓ Rejects requests with invalid credentials (should return 401)
- ✓ Accepts requests with valid credentials (should not return 401)

**File Download (4 tests)**
- ✓ Returns 404 for non-existent files
- ✓ Blocks path traversal attempts (security test)
- ✓ Downloads existing files with correct Content-Type
- ✓ Includes Content-Disposition header for downloads

**Error Handling (2 tests)**
- ✓ Returns 400 for missing path parameter
- ✓ Returns 400 for empty path parameter

**Performance (1 test)**
- ✓ Responds within acceptable time limits

### 2. Documentation
**Path:** `test/integration/README.md`

Comprehensive documentation including:
- Prerequisites and setup instructions
- Three different methods to run tests
- Environment variables reference table
- Security best practices
- Troubleshooting guide
- CI/CD integration examples
- Expected output examples

### 3. Configuration Template
**Path:** `test/integration/env.example`

Template file for setting up integration test environment variables with:
- All required and optional variables
- Usage instructions
- Comments explaining each setting

### 4. Package.json Updates
Added new npm scripts:
- `test:integration` - Run only integration tests
- `test:unit` - Run only unit tests (exclude integration)

## Key Features

### 1. **Safe by Default**
- Integration tests are **skipped by default**
- Must explicitly set `INTEGRATION_TEST=true` to run
- Clear instructions printed when skipped

### 2. **Environment-Based Configuration**
- All settings configurable via environment variables
- No hardcoded credentials
- Works with different SFCC instances and sites

### 3. **Smart Test Skipping**
- Tests requiring credentials skip if not configured
- Tests requiring test files skip if files don't exist
- Informative messages explain why tests are skipped

### 4. **Comprehensive Security Testing**
- Validates authentication requirements
- Tests path traversal attack prevention
- Verifies proper HTTP status codes

### 5. **Detailed Logging**
- Configuration summary at test start
- Response times logged
- HTTP status codes reported
- Clear success/failure messages

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
INTEGRATION_TEST=true \
SFCC_HOSTNAME=zzra-039.dx.commercecloud.salesforce.com \
SFCC_SITE_ID=RefArch \
DOWNLOAD_USERNAME=your-username \
DOWNLOAD_PASSWORD=your-password \
npm run test:integration
```

### With Test File
```bash
INTEGRATION_TEST=true \
SFCC_HOSTNAME=zzra-039.dx.commercecloud.salesforce.com \
SFCC_SITE_ID=RefArch \
DOWNLOAD_USERNAME=your-username \
DOWNLOAD_PASSWORD=your-password \
TEST_FILE_PATH=src/bloomreach_engagement/CustomerFeed/customers-latest.csv \
npm run test:integration
```

### Using Environment File
```bash
# Create config file
cp test/integration/env.example my-integration-config.sh
# Edit with your values
nano my-integration-config.sh
# Run tests
source my-integration-config.sh && npm run test:integration
```

## Test Results

### When Skipped (Default)
```
89 passing (69ms)
11 pending
```

### When Enabled (Without Credentials)
```
1 passing (995ms)
8 pending
2 failing

WARNING: Credentials not configured. Some tests will fail.
```

### When Fully Configured (Expected)
```
11 passing (2s)
```

## Integration with Existing Tests

The integration tests:
- ✅ Don't interfere with unit tests
- ✅ Can be run separately via `npm run test:integration`
- ✅ Are included in full test suite but skipped by default
- ✅ Have their own directory structure
- ✅ Use standard mocha/chai like other tests

## Security Considerations

### Implemented Security Features
1. **No Hardcoded Credentials** - All credentials via environment variables
2. **Separate from Code** - Integration config files in .gitignore
3. **Path Traversal Testing** - Tests security against directory traversal
4. **Authentication Testing** - Validates proper auth requirements
5. **Clear Warnings** - Prints security reminders

### Recommendations
- ✓ Never commit credentials to version control
- ✓ Use different credentials for each environment
- ✓ Rotate credentials regularly
- ✓ Use secrets management in CI/CD
- ✓ Restrict test credential permissions

## Next Steps

To use these integration tests:

1. **Deploy the cartridge** to your SFCC sandbox
2. **Configure credentials** in Business Manager (Site Preferences > Custom Preferences)
3. **Set environment variables** (see README.md)
4. **Run tests** to verify deployment
5. **Integrate into CI/CD** (optional)

## Current Status

✅ **Integration tests created and verified**
- Tests are properly skipped by default
- Tests can be enabled via environment variable
- Configuration is clear and documented
- Tests make actual HTTP requests to SFCC instance

⚠️ **Endpoint verification**
- Tests currently get 500 error from endpoint
- This is expected if:
  - Controller not yet deployed
  - Credentials not configured in Business Manager
  - Site cartridge path not updated

## Troubleshooting Current Results

The tests are getting a **500 Internal Server Error** instead of expected **401 Unauthorized**. This typically means:

1. **Controller may not be deployed yet**
   - Solution: Deploy cartridge and add to cartridge path

2. **Credentials not configured in Business Manager**
   - Solution: Set brEngDownloadUsername and brEngDownloadPassword in Site Preferences

3. **Controller has an error**
   - Solution: Check SFCC error logs in Business Manager

To verify deployment:
1. Check Business Manager > Administration > Sites > Manage Sites > [Your Site] > Settings
2. Verify `int_bloomreach_engagement` is in the cartridge path
3. Check Site Preferences > Custom Preferences for credentials
4. Review error logs in Administration > Site Development > Development Setup > Error Log

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Create integration test file
- [x] Add comprehensive test coverage
- [x] Create documentation
- [x] Add configuration template
- [x] Update package.json scripts
- [x] Verify tests skip by default
- [x] Verify tests can be enabled
- [ ] Deploy controller to test instance
- [ ] Configure credentials in Business Manager
- [ ] Run tests against live deployment
- [ ] Verify all tests pass
- [ ] Add to CI/CD pipeline (optional)

## Summary

The integration test infrastructure is **complete and ready to use**. Once the controller is deployed and credentials are configured in the SFCC instance, these tests will provide comprehensive verification that the file download endpoint is working correctly in the deployed environment.
